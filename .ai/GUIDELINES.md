# Strata

This repository is a Laravel package. Keep the package focused, idiomatic, and easy for Laravel developers to install, test, and maintain.

## Package Conventions

- Use Laravel-native package APIs and the existing service provider shape before adding abstractions.
- Keep package names, namespaces, Composer metadata, publish tags, documentation, and examples aligned with `sunchayn/strata`.
- Add only the files and dependencies needed for the package behavior being implemented.
- Prefer explicit Laravel package code over helper abstractions unless the extension point is real.
- Keep tests focused on observable package behavior through public APIs, service provider wiring, commands, routes, published resources, and documentation promises.

## Structure Conventions

- `src/Http/<Domain>/{Controllers,Requests,Resources}`: HTTP concerns grouped by domain rather than by transport type. An API endpoint is loaded through `routes/api.php`, a browser-facing one through `routes/web.php`. Create only the subfolder a domain's endpoint actually needs.
- `src/Modules/<Domain>/{Actions,Services,...}`: business logic grouped by domain, kept out of `Http` and `Console`. Create a domain's folder only when it has real content. Do not pre-scaffold empty modules.
- `src/Console/Commands`: package Artisan commands, registered through the provider's console-guarded `commands()` call.

## Quick Commands

- Full validation: `composer test`
- Formatting check: `composer style:check`
- Static analysis: `composer analyse`
- Tests, in parallel: `composer test:parallel`
- Switch Laravel version: `composer switch:l12` (or `l13`)

## Working with Subagents

The primary session plans, wires the feature through the service provider, and reviews the result. It delegates the actual implementation to a subagent whenever a change is non-trivial, spanning multiple files, adding a capability, or refactoring existing behavior. Before calling any such change done, review the subagent's diff against `write-php-code`, `write-comments`, and `write-php-test`, then run `task-finalization`. A one-file, low-risk change does not need the split; write and verify it directly.

## Local Skills

- `write-php-code`: use when writing or refactoring PHP classes. Covers strict typing, explicit types, constructor promotion, and when an abstraction earns its place.
- `write-comments`: use whenever writing or reviewing a comment, in PHP or, when the frontend feature is kept, in TypeScript/Vue.
- `write-php-test`: use when writing, editing, fixing, or reviewing package tests with PHPUnit, Paratest, and Orchestra Testbench. Covers TDD, where a test belongs, and its naming, block structure, and mocking conventions.
- `task-finalization`: use before marking any change complete, to run the quality tools that match what changed.
- `package-compatibility`: use when reviewing code, dependencies, or CI against the PHP and Laravel support matrix.
