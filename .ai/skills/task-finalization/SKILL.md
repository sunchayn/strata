# Task Finalization

## Primary Goal

Never call a change done until the tools that would catch a regression have actually run against it.

## Workflow

1. Check which files changed (`git status`, `git diff --name-only`).
2. If a PHP file under `src/`, `tests/`, `config/`, `tools/` changed, run in order: `composer analyse`, `composer rector`, `composer style:fix`, then `composer test:parallel` filtered to the affected area while iterating, and `composer test:parallel` before finishing.
3. If the implementation was delegated to a subagent, review its diff against `write-php-code`, `write-comments`, and `write-php-test` before accepting it. That delegation decision is made before writing code, not here.

## Examples

- After adding a config key, run the PHP suite (step 2) even if only `config/*.php` changed. `composer analyse` catches a mismatched type. `composer test` catches a broken merge.
- After a refactor across several classes done by a subagent, review its diff against `write-php-code` before running the PHP suite.

## Anti-Patterns

- Running the full validation suite unconditionally when only documentation changed.
- Skipping `composer test` because `composer style:fix` and `composer analyse` passed.
- Accepting a subagent's diff without checking it against the coding and testing skills.
